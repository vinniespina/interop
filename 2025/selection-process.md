# Interop 2025 proposal selection process

Interop 2025 is an effort to increase interoperability across browsers in key technical areas that are of high priority to web developers and end users. This effort is part of the [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) (WPT) project — an automated test suite for web standards — and run by a team of representatives from companies that make substantial contributions to browser rendering engines (including Apple, Bocoup, Google, Igalia, Microsoft, and Mozilla).

Please see the [Interop 2024 Dashboard](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024) and [Interop 2024 README](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/blob/main/2024/README.md) for the current iteration of the project.

Each iteration of the project starts with an open call for proposals, followed by a selection and prioritization process by each participating organization. Final decision on the inclusion of a proposal is made by [consensus](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/blob/main/charter.md#:~:text=The%20team%20makes%20decisions%20based%20on%20consensus.%20A%20decision%20has%20consensus%20if%20it%20has%20support%20from%20at%20least%20two%20participating%20organizations%20and%20no%20opposition). For Interop 2025, the timeline and the selection process is as described below.


## Timeline

This is the general timeline for the Interop 2025 proposal selection process. The dates are centered on the Interop team meeting (Thursdays). Please note that the timelines are subject to change.

*   Proposal submission window (3 weeks): Sept 19th, 2024 to Oct 3rd, 2024
*   First round of feedback on proposals that do not meet the Interop project criteria (2 weeks): Oct 3rd, 2024 to Oct 17th, 2024
*   Proposal selection and prioritization: Oct - Dec 2024
*   Interop 2024 carryover evaluation and 2025 grouping: Dec 2024 - Jan 2025
*   Scope of the Interop 2025 project will be published, the first half of February, 2025.


## Proposal selection phases


### Phase 1: Filtering (Oct 3rd to Oct 17th)

Interop meeting dates: Oct 3rd, Oct 10th, Oct 17th
[Visibility] All decisions and results from this phase will be published on the Interop repo.

In this stage, proposals that do not meet the criteria set by the Interop team will be filtered out. Feedback would be provided to the proposal authors to verify any additional data points that should be considered prior to exclusion. The Interop team will decide on the exclusion of proposals, based on consensus and proposal authors will be informed at the end of this phase. 

There are two steps to this phase:
1. Proposal refinement: Oct 4th, 2024 to Oct 10th, 2024 - feedback would be provided to proposal authors on the Interop repo. 
2. First round of feedback on proposals that do not meet the Interop project criteria would be provided to proposal authors on the Interop repo.


### Phase 2: Ranking (Oct 18th to Oct 31st)

Interop meeting dates: Oct 24th, Oct 31st
[Visibility] All decisions, made in Interop team meetings during this phase, will be confidential. However, organizations can choose to publish their own rankings, outside of the Interop program.

In this stage, the focus would be on organizations picking areas where there is internal alignment on the specific feature or area being important enough to work on from a user/web developer perspective. Each organization will have different rubrics for prioritization. However, where applicable, organizations can choose to have any data used for prioritization be shared publicly.

3. Each organization will select proposals for the prioritization discussion by putting a High/Low priority signal against each proposal where they have internal alignment to do the work. A low priority signal would indicate a willingness to support the proposal, if other organizations also deem it to be important. Organizations can also express any objections at this point.
4. Any proposal that has at least 2 organizations expressing high priority and no objections, would be moved forward to the next phase of consensus building. Any organization that posts an objection would also outline the reasoning for it, to the Interop team. The ranking of proposals would be done asynchronously, ahead of the Interop meetings.


### Phase 3: Prioritization (Nov 1st to Dec 5th)

Interop meeting dates: Nov 7th, Nov 14th, Nov 21st, Dec 5th
[Visibility] All decisions made in this phase will be confidential. 

In this stage, each organization will further prioritize proposals for a specific year (Interop 2025). This is more involved and a complex process where each organization weighs engineering priorities and available resources.

5. From the list of proposals that get through to Phase 3, each organization will have an opportunity to further prioritize internally and build consensus within the Interop Team based on available signals.
6. Organizations can also object to any proposal at this point.
7. Any proposal that has support from 2 organizations and does not have any objection, will be considered included in Interop 2025. At the end of this phase, the expectation is that the Interop team will have a first draft of proposals that are included in Interop 2025.


### Phase 4: Carryovers and Grouping (Dec 6th to Dec 19th)

Interop meeting dates: Dec 12th and Dec 19th
[Visibility] All decisions and results from this phase will be confidential.

In this stage, the Interop team will evaluate progress made in Interop 2024 focus areas and create a first draft of areas that will be carried over to Interop 2025. In addition, the proposals from phase 3 will be weighed against any carryover focus areas from Interop 2024. The outcome from this phase is a second draft of prioritized proposals for Interop 2025 (this will include new proposals and carryover focus areas) with a high-level grouping. This stage will include the steps below:

8. Interop 2024 carryover evaluation - this will be done live in the Interop team meeting.
9. Grouping of proposals, in conjunction with carryover areas - a draft will be created and worked on, asynchronously. Decisions would be made live in the Interop team meeting.
10. This phase will also include decisions on inclusion of investigation effort proposals, by consensus.


### Phase 5: Final decisions (Jan 9th to Jan 30th)

Interop meeting dates: Jan 9th, Jan 16th, Jan 23rd, Jan 30th
[Visibility] The final list of focus areas would be made public at launch

In this stage, final decisions on prioritizations and grouping will be made.
